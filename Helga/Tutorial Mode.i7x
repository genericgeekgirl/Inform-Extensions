Tutorial Mode by Helga begins here.

"Modified from Tutorial Mode, Version 2, by Emily Short, for use specifically with Discover a World."

Tutorial mode is a truth state that varies. Tutorial mode is false; [DEBUG]

Section - Forcing player response

The expected command is indexed text that varies. 
The held rule is a rule that varies. 
The completed instruction list is a list of rules that varies.

Understand "restore" or "quit" or "save" or "restart" or "version" as "[meta]".
Understand "imagination" or "img" or "about" or "info" or "credits" or "help" or "hint" or "hints" or "menu" or "walkthrough" as "[meta]".

After reading a command when tutorial mode is true (this is the require correct response rule):	
	if the player's command includes "[meta]", make no decision;
	if the player's command includes "study":
		say "That command is not available right now.";
		reject the player's command;
	if the player's command includes "x", replace the matched text with "examine";
	if the player's command includes "i", replace the matched text with "inventory";
	if the expected command is "", make no decision;
	let the translated command be indexed text;
	let the translated command be "[the player's command in lower case]";
	replace the text "the " in the expected command with "";
	replace the text "the " in the translated command with "";
	if the translated command is the expected command:
		now the expected command is "";
		if the held rule is a selector listed in the Table of Instruction Followups:
			choose row with a selector of the held rule in the Table of Instruction Followups;
			say "[as the parser][followup entry][as normal][paragraph break]";
		add the held rule to the completed instruction list;
		now the held rule is the little-used do nothing rule;
	otherwise:
		say "[as the parser][one of]Nope[or]No[or]Sorry[or]Whoops[at random][one of], that's not it[or][or] -- try again[at random].[as normal]";
		reject the player's command;

Section - Instructional Rules
