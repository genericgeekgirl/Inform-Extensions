Hyperlink Interface ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

This documentation is copied directly from the extension "Keyword Interface" by Aaron Reed. The main modifications in the text are: "Keyword" replaced by "Hyperlink", "typed" replaced by "clicked", the color customization removed and so on.

This extension emulates the emphasized keyword system for streamlining common IF input, as seen in "Blue Lacuna" and substitutes color emphasis with hyperlinks. Nouns, directions, and topics are highlighted, underlined and can be clicked to examine, move, or discuss, respectively. Topics are implemented only in skeletal form to allow for integration with any conversation sytem. A full system for letting the player select his own preferred style scheme is also included. The extension is compatible with Glulx only.

Section: Basic Usage

Hyperlink Interface allows an emphasis style to be set for one of three possible categories. Each of these can be enabled or disabled independently by the author or player. By default, they are set as follows:

	Object hyperlink highlighting is true.
	Direction hyperlink highlighting is true.
	Topic hyperlink highlighting is false.

These can be enabled or disabled at any time during play, or globally with a "first when play begins" rule:

	First when play begins: now object hyperlink highlighting is false.


Section: Objects

When object hyperlink highlighting is set to true, the extension will automatically highlight and underline objects listed in bulk when looking or taking inventory, as well as objects manually invoked in room descriptions if their names are bracketed.

	The Office is a room. "Only a single [lamp] illuminates this dim office, bare except for a solitary [desk].". A metal lamp and a desk are scenery in the office. A telephone book is on the desk.

This produces output like the following (where emphasis is marked with asterisks):

	The Office
	Only a simple metal *lamp* illuminates this dim office, bare except for a solitary *desk*.

	On the *desk* is a telephone *book*.

The emphasized word will be the final word of the object's printed name. To change this, you can use the object's "keyword" property, which should be one of the other words in the printed name. You can also define an object as "hyperlinkless," in which case it will not be emphasized. Finally, you can manually mark an "[o]object[x]" with the o and x tags or a "[o]scenery[x]" with the s and x tags to emphasize it in object or scenery style.

	A telephone of Swedish origin with keyword "telephone" is in the Office. The description of the telephone is "You notice a faint [o]smudge[x] of lipstick on the receiver.". Some scattered cigarettes are a hyperlinkless thing in the Office.

Produces:

	"You can also see a *telephone* of Swedish origin and some scattered cigarettes here."

Object highlighting, when activated, highlights hyperlinks when looking or taking inventory. If you want to disable one of these you can use code like the following:

	The Hyperlink Interface highlight objects when looking rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Conversely, if you want object highlighting during other times, you can use code like this:
	
	Rule for printing the name of a thing (called item) while asking which do you mean:
		carry out the object hyperlinking activity with item.

In certain cases, the same object may be highlighted twice in a room description. This is due to a limitation of Inform's rules for printing the name of an object wherein there's no easy way to tell whether it's being printed to memory or the screen; anyone who knows a workaround for this, please let Aaron Reed know.

Section: Directions

When direction hyperlink highlighting is set to true and cardinal directions are wrapped in brackets in room descriptions, these will be emphasized as they are printed.

	"Gloomy passages depart to the [south] and [east]."

Compassless navigation as seen in Blue Lacuna is also available by simply adding the directional keyword you'd like as a synonym for the relative direction, limiting this to the specific room that keyword works for, and wrapping the relevant word in "d" and "x" tags.

	"Gloomy passages depart down a dusty set of [d]stairs[x] and through a wide [d]passage[x]." Understand "stairs" as south when location is Gloomy Tunnel. Understand "passage" as east when location is Gloomy Tunnel.

An "exits" verb is included with Hyperlink Interface to assist blind users or those without color interpreters (who in the above example would have no way of knowing what words would move them about). The "exits" verb lists all of the cardinal exits from the current location. If your game uses compassless navigation, you may want to extend this verb to print your keywords instead (see the example below for one way to do this).

If your game defines custom directions, you will need to explicitly set their printed names, but should then be able to use them like any other direction.

	Starboard is a direction. The opposite of starboard is port. The printed name of starboard is "starboard". Port is a direction. The opposite of port is starboard.  The printed name of port is "port". Upper deck is starboard of Captain's Cabin and port of Base of the Rigging. The description of Upper Deck is "The deck is crawling with pirates. The only free exits are to [port] and [starboard].". 

Section: Topics

Since there are so many vastly different conversation systems, support for highlighting conversation topics is only vestigial. You can turn it on via "topic hyperlink highlighting" and invoke it with the "[t]topic[x]" wrappers, but everything else will have to be done by hand to match your own conversation system.

Section: Control

As noted above, authors can enable or disable hyperlink highlighting for any component. Players also have control over hyperlinking by using the HYPERLINKS verb, which brings up a menu with flexible options, customised to which hyperlinks are enabled.

If hyperlinks are a crucial component of your game, you can add the following:

	First when play begins: now hyperlinks required is true.

This will bring up a message before your game begins ensuring that players can see the hyperlink highlighting, and giving them an option to adjust styles.

You can print some stock explanatory text (customized to which hyperlinks are enabled) by using the following line, perhaps in the carry out rule for an "about" command:

	show HI message for hyperlink-introduction

The three modes are object-word, direction-word, topic-word. For Glulx games, possible styles are hyperlink-bold-style, hyperlink-italics-style, hyperlink-fixedwidth-style, and hyperlink-no-style.

All of the messages the extension prints are customizeable by amending the Table of Hyperlink Interface messages, eg:

	Table of Hyperlink Interface messages (amended)
	HI message			HI output
	hyperlink-setting-instructions		"[story title] makes use of emphasized hyperlinks. It is important that your interpreter program correctly displays them with some form of emphasis. Type a number below to cycle through display options until you find one that shows clearly on your system."

The messages and how they currently begin are as follows:

	not-a-verb-I-recognise	"That's neither a verb I [if using the American dialect option]recognize[else]recognise[end if] nor a hyperlink you can use right now."
	hyperlink-introduction	"As you read [story title], you'll see certain emphasized hyperlinks in the prose. Click on any hyperlink to advance the story. [if object hyperlink highlighting is true]You can click an emphasized [o]object[x] to examine that item more closely. [end if][if direction hyperlink highlighting is true]An emphasized [d]direction[x] indicates that clicking that word will move you that direction or towards that distant scenery. [end if][if topic hyperlink highlighting is true]An emphasized word in [t]conversation[x] means clicking that word will steer the conversation towards that topic. [end if]If the hyperlink[if the number of active hyperlink systems > 1]s are[else] is[end if] not distinct, type LINKS to adjust them for your system."
	welcome-message	"Welcome to [o][story title][x], release [release number].[paragraph break]If no words above were underlined or emphasized, press H now.[paragraph break]Press [t]N[x] to begin from the beginning or [t]R[x] to restore an existing story."
	hyperlink-setting-instructions	"[story title] makes use of emphasized hyperlinks. It is [if hyperlinks required is true]necessary[else]recommended[end if] that your interpreter program correctly displays them with some form of emphasis. Type a number below to cycle through display options until you find one that shows clearly on your system."
	hyperlink-instructions-object	"Emphasized [o]object[x] hyperlinks currently look like [o]this[x]."
	hyperlink-instructions-scenery	"Emphasized [s]scenery[x] hyperlinks currently look like [s]this[x]."
	hyperlink-instructions-direction	"Emphasized [d]exit[x] hyperlinks currently look like [d]this[x]."
	hyperlink-instructions-topic	"Emphasized [t]topic[x] hyperlinks currently look like [t]this[x]."
	hyperlink-instructions-disabled	"**A warning: The emphasized hyperlinks are integral to [story title]'s design. It may be difficult or impossible to know how to continue if emphasis is not visible.**"
	hyperlink-instructions-distinct	"**A warning: it may at times be useful to be able to differentiate between the various kinds of hyperlinks.**"
	hyperlink-instructions-end	"Press 0 when you're finished here.[run paragraph on]"


Section: Disambiguation

Inform's normal disambiguation is designed around the notion that every command begins with a verb, which means conflicts between keywords, and between keywords and verbs, are hard or impossible to control. The best solution is to make sure your object, direction, and topic keywords have no overlap.

*If an object and direction keyword* are in the same scope, the parser silently assumes the player means the direction keyword, and will print a seemingly useless "(the object)" clarification if the player manually examines that object instead.

*If a highlighted keyword matches a verb*, the verb will take precedence. For example, typing "set" to reference a chess set would instead produce the message "What do you want to set?" The best way to avoid this is to change the keyword and description of the object to avoid mentioning the verb word-- in this case "chessboard" might be a good substitute.

*Conversation systems should take precedence over objects* since this is what players will expect. See the example below for one implementation of this.


Example: * Sense of Direction - A simple usage of the extension to print bold compass directions.

The flexibility of Hyperlink  Interface means it can be used for multiple purposes. Here we strip away and focus some of its functionality to simply print compass directions in bold.

	*: "Sense of Direction"

	Include Hyperlink Interface by Leonardo Boselli.

	First when play begins: now object hyperlink highlighting is false; now the style of direction-word is hyperlink-bold-style.

	Labyrinth is south of Passage and west of Halls. Halls is south of Dungeon and west of Pit. Pit is south of Harrows. Harrows is east of Dungeon and south of Caverns. Dungeon is east of Passage and south of Abyss. Passage is south of Abattoir. Abbatoir is west of Abyss and north of Passage. Abyss is west of Caverns.   

	After looking: try exits listing.

Example: ** The Gnome's Holiday - A full example of emphasized objects, compassless directions, and conversation topics.

We'll create a slightly longer scenario with several locations and a simple puzzle, to demonstrate the full potential of Hyperlink Interface. This game has "hyperlinks required" set to true, so it begins with a menu that helps players calibrate hyperlinks.

We implement an extremely simple conversation system to demonstrate emphasized topic words. Note that a real conversation system would need to be much more robust and elaborate. We'll also create a variation on the exits verb to show our compassless exits

	*: "The Gnome's Holiday"

	Include Hyperlink Interface by Leonardo Boselli.    

	First when play begins: now topic hyperlink highlighting is true; now hyperlinks required is true.  

	After printing the banner text: say "First time players type ABOUT for more instructions.".

	Section - Conversation

	hyperlink-asking is an action applying to one thing. Understand "[a speakable]" as hyperlink-asking when the number of other people in location > 0.

	Carry out hyperlink-asking:
